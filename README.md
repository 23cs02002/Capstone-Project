# EduSync-Using-C-Language

## Introduction

- This project is a collaborative effort to create a student database management portal named "EduSync" using C language.
- It incorporates various features typically present in such systems, along with some innovative additions.
- The project runs solely on terminal as per the project requirements.

## Overview

The project demonstrates a database management system's core format with attempts to make real-life applications possible. Three tiers of login types are available: Admin, Faculty, and Student.

## How to Use

- Fork or download the repository.
- Compile and run "EduSync.c" after downloading both "EduSync.c" and "election.h".
- Use provided credentials for Admin login or automatic password generation for new students and faculty.

## Compilation Instructions

This guide assumes that `gcc` is already configured in your system. If not, please install and configure it first.

### Compiling the Source Code

Use the following command to compile the `EduSync.c` file:

```bash
gcc -o EduSync.exe EduSync.c -lwinmm
```
This command does the following:

- `gcc` : Calls the GNU Compiler Collection to compile the code.
- `-o EduSync.exe` : Specifies the output file name (`EduSync.exe`).
- `EduSync.c` : The C source file to be compiled.
- `-lwinmm` : Links the `winmm` library. This is a Windows multimedia API library used for functions related to background music in the program.

## Conclusion

The project enhanced skills in programming, database management, and data structures. It provided insight into joint project development, increasing innovation and error handling.
